## Transport

### UART

Listens on the UART1 interface, with GPIO5 being TX and GPIO6 being RX.

It seems like after 1 second timeout (if there wasn't anything received within 1 second) it enters the BLE mode.
But it seems like the UART interface still works...

### BLE

MAC address: **01:BF:66:20:A2:00**, name: HS-OTA (presumably "HunterSun On The Air \[update\]")

## Protocol

TODO!
